The JSMF Framework aims at simplifying and lightening the traditional (MDE)
modelling frameworks such as EMF.
Moreover, we want to push forward web technologies which could bring a lot to
model engineering (easy deployement, client-based transformations, cloud, etc.).

Thus JSMF propose an overhaul of classical modelling frameworks into Javascript.
It does not aim at replacing all the features of EMF, but propose a rather 
simpler implementation of conformance relation, model and metamodel creation.
It is notably inspired by EMF dynamic instances, e.g., dynamic creation of model
properties (attributes/references setters).

Specific Features:
JSMF, tough it is a simplification, proposes additional features such as:
- different level of conformance and type checking, allowing for loosely-defined
models (see Natural Modelling).
- promotion mechanism that allows the (meta)model designers to create a 
metamodel form modelling elements

Later on, we have planned to define an inference mechanism that permit to create 
metamodels elements from examples models (in other words metamodel emergence).
